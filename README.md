# Social-Network


For this challenge I was not given any starter code. The challenge is to create a social network API that uses a NoSQL database.

Isomnia is going to be used in order to test all provided routes.
The GET by user ID, Post a new user, PUT a user by their ID and the abilty to delete a user by the ID will prove itself functional through this back end tool.
Other functionalities are also capable, such as Getting 'thoughts' (comments posted by the user) being able to update them, delete or change them. Retreive them by their specific and special ID.
